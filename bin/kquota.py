Script to check for quota transgressions and notify the offending users.

- relies on mmrepquota to get a quick estimate of user quota
- checks all storage systems that are listed in /etc/quota_check.conf
- writes quota information in gzipped json files in the target directory for the
  affected entity (user, project, vo)
- mails a user, vo or project moderator
- can dump data to the account page (through a REST API) or in files in the user's directories
